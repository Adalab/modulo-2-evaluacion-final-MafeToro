Hello! Thank you for being here : )

This is my second module evaluation at ADALAB on the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. We build a web to consult and store animes, using the free Jikan API and JS. Please, consult the final version here: https://beta.adalab.es/modulo-2-evaluacion-final-MafeToro/. To start the project in your local you only have to use "npm install" on the terminal and then npm run dev.
